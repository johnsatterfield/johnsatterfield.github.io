title: Artifacts and Narratives

The artifacts I've chosen represent my growth in the Computer Science program, demonstrating enhancements in the following categories: software design and engineering, algorithm and data structures, and databases. For each artifact in my ePortfolio, I will provide a narrative to accompany the artifact itself. These narratives will explain why I included the artifact in my ePortfolio and reflect on the process I used to create the artifact.
