**Describe the artifact**

The artifact for this assignment comes from CS-410: Software Reverse Engineering. The file is from the final project where we reverse engineered source code into assembly code and interpreted into legacy code. The program was written in C and functions as a school application where a professor can log in, view the list of students and their grades, and make updates to the grades as needed.

**Justify inclusion**

This artifact is included in my ePortfolio, satisfying the Software Design and Engineering section. I selected this item to demonstrate my ability to analyze code and enhance the structure and security of the code. Specifically, I made enhancements such as improved structure with the switch/case statement, static functions for validating user data, and stand-in functions for manging and updating students.

**Reflect on process and enhancements**

My initial plan included removing redundant and duplicative code, provide better security for validating user credentials, and implementing the ability to add and remove students. I was able to reduce the amount of code by splitting up the program into more organized functions. A switch/case statement was added to validate the userâ€™s input from a defined list of menu options. To provide better security, the user credentials are validated against .

The initial program was created and run in the Codio environment created for the class. One of the initial challenges I faced was implementing a similar environment locally on my computer where I could edit and test the program. Other challenges I faced related to updating the code and trying to implement a database. I ended up using a file reader and happy with the overall enhancements I made to the program. I also found manipulating Stucts more difficult than expected and therefore did not add the add/remove student function.
