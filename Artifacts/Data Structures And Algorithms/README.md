# Artifact Narrative

Artifact: Data Structures and Algorithms

[Back to ePortfolio](https://johnsatterfield.github.io/)

**Describe the artifact**

The artifact for this assignment comes from CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms. The program files were developed throughout the course where we learned about the different data structures and algorithms for loading and reading data. The original programs were written in C++ and I plan to continue writing the enhancements within the same language. The data structures consist of binary search tree, linked list, and hash tables. The algorithms consist of vector sorting, quick sorting, and selection sorting.

**Justify inclusion**

This artifact will be included in my ePortfolio, satisfying the Data Structures and Algorithms section. I selected this item because it directly correlates to the skills required for this section of the ePortfolio which is showcasing and expanding on the knowledge within this area. The enhancements I proposed were to consolidate the different data structure and algorithm program files into one file. When I previously mapped out this new design format, I wanted to link the files through header files. Additionally, I proposed adding the heap sorting algorithm to the list.

**Reflect on process and enhancements**

I successfully combined all of the separate files into one program file. While my initial plan included having these files linked through header files, this was not the final outcome. Instead, I combined all the files and went through to ensure that the code did not have overlapping classes, misused variables, or any general weaknesses. 

Overall, the process of building the enhancements for this artifact were a little cumbersome. The individual program files had very similar code which I thought I could easily condense, which was not the case. I then attempted to combine all the files into a project and link them through header files but was met with a lot of errors and minimal understanding of the process. I was, however, able to successfully combine the files into one program that executes. I would also like to mention that I enjoyed reviewing these programs that were created early in the Computer Science program.
