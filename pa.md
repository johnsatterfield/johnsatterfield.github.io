Throughout my courses in the Computer Science program, I have worked on multiple projects using a wide range of programming languages and concepts. I have gained a solid understanding of the fundamental programming techniques, algorithms and data structures, mathematical computation, and the work done in the field of computer science. Specifically, I have engaged and deceloped with industry-standard programming languages and tools, operating systems, systems architecture and design, the stages of the software development lifecycle, mobile applications, and software security concepts. 

Not only do I feel I’m a well-rounded programmer by the experienced immersion, but I embrace the change of technology and choose to grow with it. As a developer and tester, I  have leardned to look at all aspects of the task to develop the best possible solution. I have also worked to ensure the products I produce are ethical and built with security in mind. Additionally, I have worked both individually and with a team to complete a common task. Using an Agile method, We rotated responsibilities to successfully demonstrate competency in each role from: Stake Holder, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, and Tester. 

The projects included in my ePortfolio demonstrate my knowledge and skills that would be valuable to any prospective company. The ability to recognize, navigate, and program logic from what would be considered different roles on a project show my flexibility for any job. What I hope to showcase most of all with my projects is my creativity and eagerness to be a better programmer and designer. From personal projects to critical self-awareness, I believe I have what it takes to add great value to any project I’m fortunate to be a part of.
