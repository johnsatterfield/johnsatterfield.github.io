title: John Satterfield's ePortfolio
filename: index
---

This professional ePortfolio will showcase my skills and abilities from the Computer Science program.  It will contain an artifact demonstrating my skills and abilities in three key categories:
* Software design and engineering
* Algorithms and data structure
* Databases

Additionally, this ePortfolio will contain the following:
* [Professional self-assessment](/#Professional)
* [Informal code review](#Informal)
* [Enhanced artifacts and narratives](#Artifacts)

## Professional Self-Assessment

The professional self-assessment reflects on the capstone and my experience in the Computer Science program as a whole.

## Informal Code Review

[Link to code review](/cr)

My code review addresses the following:
* **Existing functionality:** Identify what the code is, what it does, and how it works.
* **Code Analysis:** Review the code structure, code efficiencies, and code documentation.
* **Look for enhancement:** Walk through and explain planned enhancements

## Artifacts

The artifacts I've chosen represent my growth in the Computer Science program, demonstrating enhancements in the following categories: software design and engineering, algorithm and data structures, and databases. For each artifact in my ePortfolio, I will provide a narrative to accompany the artifact itself. These narratives will explain why I included the artifact in my ePortfolio and reflect on the process I used to create the artifact.
