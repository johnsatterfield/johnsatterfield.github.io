## Welcome to John Satterfield's ePortfolio

This professional ePortfolio will showcase my skills and abilities from the Computer Science program.  It will contain an artifact demonstrating my skills and abilities in three key categories:
* Software design and engineering
* Algorithms and data structure
* Databases

Additionally, this ePortfolio will contain the following:
* Professional self-assessment
* Informal code review
* Enhanced artifacts
* Artifact narratives

## Professional Self-Assessment

The professional self-assessment reflects on the capstone and my experience in the Computer Science program as a whole.

## Informal Code Review

My code review addresses the following:
* **Existing functionality:** Identify what the code is, what it does, and how it works.
* **Code Analysis:** Review the code structure, code efficiencies, and code documentation.
* **Look for enhancement:** Walk through and explain planned enhancements

## Artifacts

The artifacts I've chosen represent my growth in the Computer Science program, demonstrating enhancements in the following categories: software design and engineering, algorithm and data structures, and databases. For each artifact in my ePortfolio, I will provide a narrative to accompany the artifact itself. These narratives will explain why I included the artifact in my ePortfolio and reflect on the process I used to create the artifact.
