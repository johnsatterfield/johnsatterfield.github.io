My code review addresses the following:

- **Existing functionality:** Identify what the code is, what it does, and how it works.
- **Code Analysis:** Review the code structure, code efficiencies, and code documentation.
- **Look for enhancement:** Walk through and explain planned enhancements

## Refinement Plan

**Software Engineering/Design**

For the software engineering/design section of the portfolio, I will be focusing on the artifact from CS-410 Reverse Engineering. Throughout the CS-410 course, we were learning how to take binary source code, change it into assembly code, and finally rewrite it into legacy code. While we were able to successfully interpret the binary code, we did not fix or enhance to programs we were evaluating and therefore left them with many bugs or flaws. I would like to take the final project code and take the rewritten C code and fix any weaknesses within the file. Figure 1 below shows the flowchart for this section where the initial code is evaluated, fixed, and distributed. The skills from this outcome will demonstrate enhanced software engineering and design since I will be taking flawed code and correcting and securing the design structure.

**Algorithms and Data Structures**

The artifact for the Algorithms and Data Structures section will come from CS-260 which is the Data Structures and Algorithms course. This course reviewed different data structures and the algorithms they used in displaying bid items; each showing differing results in time completing. The example data structures are vectors, hash tables, trees, arrays, and structs. The algorithms used were search, sort, quick sort, and chaining. I would like to review the artifact from this course to see if there is any way of enhancing the concepts from the course. I believe I saved the bid sales data and would be curious to see if I could find a data structure or algorithm that can provide the required information in an even faster turnaround time. Doing this would showcase the skills learned in this area for the portfolio.

**Databases**

The artifact for the Databases section of the portfolio will come from CS-340 Advanced Programming Concepts where we used MongoDB to manipulate data from a database. I would like to try to implement either a full-stack .NET web application that can be used to analyze and manipulate the data or some form of HTML interface. The skills illustrated would be enhanced from the original course in demonstrating a higher understanding of MongoDB and database manipulation using an interactive interface. I checked and still have access to the database in Codio and plan to use that database connection for the HTML or .NET interface.

**ePortfolio Overall**

As I complete the coding assignments for the different sections of the portfolio, I believe they will display a well-rounded skillset I have learned throughout my courses. Many of the programs will be able to run without any manual environment setups which makes interpreting the code easier for others viewing my portfolio. I think that I will have to be mindful of how I portray the different sections, so my portfolio remains organized especially for future updates as I work on more projects. The main skills I would like to have displayed through the artifacts chosen above is secure coding using best-practice methods, range of knowledge (programming concepts, databases, etc.) and creativity.
